# wifi_blog

Following the O'Reilly book: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow",
by Aur&eacute;lien G&eacute;ron,
using the TU Delft campus as living lab Wi-Fi data.

This is a rather messy repository with lots of duplicated code in Jupyter Notebooks. These are the notebooks I used to work through chapter 2 of G&eacute;ron's book using Wi-Fi connection data from the TU Delft campus, summed per building and 5 minute interval. The index of the notebook shows the order of work.

I am currently writing a blog about this work.
